# Is Hacker Experience 2 a free software?

Yes, HE2 is a free software, as defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). You have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Please notice that the *free* in "free software" means freedom, not necessarily *gratis*. 

# Is Hacker Experience 2 open source?

Yes. You can track the development of the game, and all related software, at the [Hacker Experience Development Center](https://dev.hackerexperience.com).

# Why I can't find any source of the game?

We are a small team with a very busy schedule. In order to be able to handle massive community participation and contribution, we decided to take a gradual disclosure of the game source code.

Instead of releasing everything right away and being overwhelmed with several questions about different applications and scopes, we will give ourselves time to organize better our current code and documentation, and then release one major software per month. See schedule and timeline at https://letsbuildagame.org.

# What is Hacker Experience 2 software license?

HE2 is made of several software. The core (server) and all client interfaces are released under the AGPLv3 license. All supporting libraries created by us are either MIT or MPL-licensed.
