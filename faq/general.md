# Is there a Hacker Experience 1?

Yes.  Hacker Experience 1 (HE1) is the first version of Hacker Experience, released in 2014. It currently has around 500,000 players and is quite addictive, according to some people. And you can [play it for free](https://legacy.hackerexperience.com).

# Is Hacker Experience 1 open source?

Not yet, but it will be. Once HE2 gets released, HE1 code will be made open source. We (Neoart Labs) will keep the servers running. We'll also assign to the project a couple of maintainers, who will accept community patches to fix bugs or release new features. Once HE1 gets open sourced we will remove all ads and premium will no longer exist.
