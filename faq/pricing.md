# Is it possible to play Hacker Experience 2 for free?

Yes, you can play HE2 without paying a dime. In order to be able to play for free, you must host the server software yourself. It's not as technically challenging as it seems, and we are still here to help you :)

# Can I play Hacker Experience 2 without hosting a game server?

Yes. For those who do not want to set up a game server, you can create an HEOnline account and play Hacker Experience 2 online without any hassle.

# What is HEOnline?

HEOnline is the official game server provided by Neoart Labs, the company sponsoring Hacker Experience. It allows you to play online against thousands of other players without worrying about setup.

# Is HEOnline subscription based?

You can choose whichever is best for you: pay monthly or only once for your HEOnline account. 

# How much does HEOnline cost?

For the final release we expect to have a monthly subscription of $5 and a lifetime account for $25. Prices may vary slightly if we have unexpected servers and taxes expenses (or savings). Preorder and crowdfunding prices are much lower given the risk and early access factors. 

# Can I get an HEOnline account for free? 

Yes. We are quite generous to contributors, so a nice way to get an HEOnline account for free is by helping us build HE2. Sounds a great deal, right? Check https://letsbuildagame.org for more information on how you can help. We also plan to add "play-to-pay" in the future. This means you can extend your subscription by paying in-game money. 

# Where can I buy an HEOnline account?

Hacker Experience 2 is still under active development, but you can preorder (and help fund the game) an HEOnline account at our [crowdfunding campaign](https://igg.me/at/hacker-experience).
