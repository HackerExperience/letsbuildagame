            |  - Define the foundations
          p.
            Our first step is to define the foundations of the project.
            Stuff like:
          ul
            li What is the game about?
            li What are the game objectives?
            li What directions should the game take?
            li How can we keep the community organized?
          p
            | Most of this planning already took place. We have a well-defined 
            em foundation
            |  for the game, but it can become anything with your ideas and
            | feedback.

            strong Step 2
            |  - Design the game

          p.
            The next step is to actually design the game.
          p.
            The gameplay and features that shape the game are designed on this
            step. They are extensions of the foundations defined previously.
          p
            | This is an endless step. It means we are 
            em always
            |  designing and improving the game, even if it has already been
            | released.

            strong Step 3
            |  - Plan the game architecture

          p.
            Now that we have a better idea of what game we are building, we can
            start planning its software. Common questions on this step are:

          ul
            li What is the underlying server architecture?
            li What programming languages will we use?
            li What tools will we use?
            li How will the user interface look like?
            li What platforms will be supported?
          p.
            Most of this planning already took place, but we'll take the time to
            review everything with the community.

            |  - Develop the game

          p.
            Finally, it's time to get our hands dirty.
          p
            | On this step, the most challenging of all, it's when we
            | incrementally develop 
            em each
            |  software that makes up the game.
          p.
            It might come as a surprise that our game is made of more than one
            software.
          p
            | This is an endless step. It means we are 
            em always
            |  developing and maintaining each software, even if the game has
